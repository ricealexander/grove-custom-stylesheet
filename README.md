### Dependencies
Dependencies are found in `package.json`, under "devDependencies". A few notable ones:

`grunt`: [Grunt](https://gruntjs.com/) is a task-runner. We use it to set up tasks we can run from our terminal.

`sass`: [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) is a css-preprocessor. It gives us advanced CSS capabilites and compiles to a simple CSS File.

`postcss`: [PostCSS](https://postcss.org/) is used with other plugins to format our CSS file after Sass generates it.

<br>

### Getting Started

To run this project, you must install:

1. **[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)**

2. **A unix-style terminal**, such as:
    * [Git Bash](https://git-scm.com/downloads) (for Windows)
    * [iTerm2](https://www.iterm2.com/) (for Mac)
    * [Hyper](https://hyper.is/)
    * VSCode's [Integrated Terminal](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/integrated-terminal)

3. **A modern text editor**, such as:
    * [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
    * [Atom](https://atom.io/)
    * [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/)


We'll be using **Node.js** for **Node Package Manager** (NPM), which manages our project dependencies and tooling.

<br>

#### Make sure Node.js installed correctly
Type the following into your terminal. It should return a version number (e.g. `v10.16.2`)
```shell
node --version
```

#### Make sure NPM installed correctly
Type the following into your terminal. It should return a version number (e.g. `6.9.0`)
```shell
npm --version
```

<br>

#### Clone the Repository with Git
From here, you'll need to clone this repository. We use **Git** for Version Control, to keep track of changes to our project. It solves issues with conflicts when multiple people are working with the same project, and makes it easy to identify when a file changed.

It is strongly recommended that you become comfortable with Git in the terminal, and there are plenty of online resources to do so:
* [An Introduction to Git](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/what-is-git-and-how-to-use-it-c341b049ae61/)
* [Git - The Simple Guide](https://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/)
* [Git and GitHub Tutorial for Beginners](https://product.hubspot.com/blog/git-and-github-tutorial-for-beginners)

<br>

#### From The Terminal
1. Navigate to the directory you want to put your local copy in.
2. Clone the repository to your local machine
3. Navigate to this new directory
```shell
git clone https://github.com/ricealexander/grove-custom-stylesheet.git
cd grove-custom-stylesheet
```
<br>

#### With Github Desktop
If you would prefer not to work with git from the terminal, you can install a GUI, such as [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/). This will give you a visual representation of what files have been changed with controls for most basic git tasks.

1. [Download](https://desktop.github.com/) Github Desktop and connect your Github account.
2. When prompted, choose a default location to save your repository (defaults to _Documents/Github_ on Windows).
3. When prompted, choose to Clone an existing repository and select "grove-custom-stylesheet" from the drop-down list.

Open your terminal and navigate to this new directory.

<br>

### Install Project Dependencies and Tooling
From the terminal, in your "grove-custom-stylesheet" directory, type the following to install the project dependencies: (this may take a while)
```shell
npm install
```

Now everything should be set up so that we can run our project on the command line. **package.json** is a file that exists to identify our project to NPM and store our dependencies and scripts. Anything listed under "scripts" can be run with the `npm run` command.

For example, this command would run our build script:
```shell
npm run build
```

<br>

### Generating the Stylesheet

By this point you should have this project cloned and the dependencies installed.

1. **Customize `sass/_grove-variables.scss` with your theme settings.** If you'd like to find a list of all of your Grove variables, you can navigate to any page of the production site, open your Developer tools with `Ctrl + Shift + I`, and scroll to the bottom of the Styles panel under the Elements tab, for a selector called `:root{}`.

    ![List of Grove Properties](./.github/grove-custom-properties-list.png)

    The easiest way to update `sass/_grove-variables.scss` is to copy the list of custom properties from `:root {}`, paste them into _grove-variables.scss, and perform a find and replace to turn `--` into `$`.

2. **Run `npm run build` from your terminal** to generate the stylesheet. There should now be a file called `dist/custom-stylesheet.css` with the updated sheet.

<br>

### Deploying With Netlify

[Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) is an ideal hosting site for a project like this. It's free, fast, and can be set to automatically re-build the project when it changes.

The easiest approach is to [Sign Up](https://app.netlify.com/signup) with your GitHub account. Once signed up, you should be taken to your team page.

1. Click **New site from Git** on the right side of the page.

    ![New site from Git](./.github/netlify-new-site-from-git.png)

2. Under **Continuous Deployment**, select your preferred Git host. In our case, that is **GitHub**.

    ![Create new site](./.github/netlify-create-new-site.png)

3. You will be prompted to find a repo. The first time you do this, you will need to get permissions from GitHub to connect to Netlify. Use the prompts to locate the repository.

    ![Configure GitHub App](./.github/netlify-configure-github-app.png)

4. Now you will need to enter your build settings. We want to deploy from our `master` branch. Under **Basic Build Settings**, set **Build command** to `npm run build` and **Publish directory** to `dist/`.

    Now, anytime you push to the master branch, Netlify will run our build script and publish the dist directory to our website.

    ![Basic Build Settings](./.github/netlify-basic-build-settings.png)

5. Once this is done, Netlify creates a new URL for us. It will resemble
<br>`https://adjective-noun-ab1234.netlify.app`

    You can make sure it works by visiting your stylesheet at
    <br>`https://adjective-noun-ab1234.netlify.app/custom-stylesheet.css`

    You can manage your site from Netlify's overview dashboard, customize the name under Site settings > General > Site information > [Change site name], or [set up a custom domain](https://docs.netlify.com/domains-https/custom-domains/) under Domain settings.

<br>

### Adding Stylesheet to Grove CMS

1. You must have Admin access in Grove. Navigate to Sites & Settings > Front-End and scroll to the very bottom

2. Under **Custom Scripts And Styles**, click **Add Custom Head Elements**

3. Fill our the Custom Head Elements Module:

    _Custom Head Element_
    <br>**Internal Name** `Custom Stylesheets`
    <br>Leave **HTTP Methods**, **URL Pattern**, and **Content Types** blank.
    <br>Under **Elements** click Add > Link Element

    _Link Element_
    <br>**Internal Name** `Grove Custom Stylesheet`
    <br>**Attribute: "rel"** `stylesheet`
    <br>**Attribute: "href"** `https://adjective-noun-ab1234.netlify.app/custom-stylesheet.css`
    <br>Leave all other fields blank.

    SAVE.

Your custom stylesheet should now be applied to all pages on your site.

<br>

### Other Questions and Answers

**Question: How can I rename custom-stylesheet.css?**
<br>Answer: The name of the stylesheet is controlled in `gruntfile.js` under sass > dist

**Question: What is SASS and why are we using it?**
<br>Answer: [SASS (Syntactically-Awesome Stylesheets)](https://sass-lang.com/) is a CSS pre-processor. We can create a project using an advanced syntax and it transforms into a regular CSS file.

Some useful features SASS gives us include:

* Variables, Functions, and Mixins for more powerful logic.
* Scoped CSS Selectors.
* Allows for a modular structure, with CSS housed in multiple files.
